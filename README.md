Simulation of Binary Classifier with Neural Networks using P5.JS and Synaptic.js

## Overview
I have created the simulation of Binary Classifier with Neural Networks using P5.JS graphics library and Synaptic.js Deep Learning library.
<br>
<br>
User can insert the data-points on canvas as well as change the class of the data-point at runtime and accordingly the binary classifier would change its parameters.
<br>
<br>
[Synaptic](http://caza.la/synaptic) - The javascript architecture-free neural network library for node.js and the browser, is used for multi-layer perceptron.
<br>
<br>
**sketch.js** contains the core logic for the simulation.
